### Singly Linked List

## The data structure is still in development, what to expect next version '0.0.2' :  
         To Do (in no particular priority or order):
            - More Testing, Exception Handling, More Consistency. 
            - Deep Copying; Without any importing of external modules. (if possible)
            - Main Issue/Assumption: 
                - Using C to implement and then extend python is much better.
                - See python documentation based on appropriate version.
                - Will be much more efficent.
            - More effective and efficient design and algorithmic implementation. 
            - Writing Secure Code, i.e. unbreakable.
            - Follow PEP standard, more closely.
            - Various constructors e.g. LinkedList().fromiterable() 
            - If a custom class/not a builtin has a string representation, this will be added to the linkedlist.
            - More Methods: e.g. Remove first node instance by value, __getitem__, __setitem__, reverse_recursive, merge(operator of +)
            - Various constructors: from iterables (list, tuple etc...) 
    # Code style in PEP and formatting/syntactical sugar refactoring.
